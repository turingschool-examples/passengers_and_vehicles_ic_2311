Use TDD to create a `Passenger` class that responds to the following interaction pattern. For the `adult?` method, a `Passenger` is considered an adult if they are age 18 or older.

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/passenger'
# => true

pry(main)> charlie = Passenger.new({"name" => "Charlie", "age" => 18})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fc1ad88b3c0...>

pry(main)> taylor = Passenger.new({"name" => "Taylor", "age" => 12})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2cf1b0...>

pry(main)> charlie.name
# => "Charlie"

pry(main)> charlie.age
# => 18

pry(main)> charlie.adult?
# => true

pry(main)> taylor.adult?
# => false

pry(main)> charlie.driver?
# => false

pry(main)> charlie.drive

pry(main)> charlie.driver?
# => true
```

## Iteration 2

Use TDD to create a `Vehicle` class that responds to the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/vehicle'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/passenger'
# => true

pry(main)> vehicle = Vehicle.new("2001", "Honda", "Civic")    
# => #<Vehicle:0x00007fe0da9c63d8...>

pry(main)> vehicle.year
# => "2001"

pry(main)> vehicle.make
# => "Honda"

pry(main)> vehicle.model
# => "Civic"

pry(main)> vehicle.speeding?
# => false

pry(main)> vehicle.speed

pry(main)> vehicle.speeding?
# => true

pry(main)> vehicle.passengers
# => []

pry(main)> charlie = Passenger.new({"name" => "Charlie", "age" => 18})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da1ec450...>

pry(main)> jude = Passenger.new({"name" => "Jude", "age" => 20})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2730e0...>

pry(main)> taylor = Passenger.new({"name" => "Taylor", "age" => 12})    
# => #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2cf1b0...>

pry(main)> vehicle.add_passenger(charlie)    

pry(main)> vehicle.add_passenger(jude)    

pry(main)> vehicle.add_passenger(taylor)    

pry(main)> vehicle.passengers
# => [#<Passenger:0x00007fe0da1ec450...>, #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2730e0...>, #<Passenger:0x00007fe0da2cf1b0...>]

pry(main)> vehicle.num_adults
# => 2
```

## Iteration 3

You have been contracted by the National Park Service to create a program that can track revenue for its parks. Specifically, they would like you to implement the following features:

  1. Each park has a name and admission price, as well as a way to read that data

In order to pass this IC, you'll need to have completed all prior requirements, as well as completing at least one of the requirements below. (It's recommended to try to complete all of the below requirements if possible.)

  2. Each park can list all the vehicles that entered the park
  3. Each park can list all the passengers that entered the park
  4. Each park can calculate revenue generated. Revenue is generated by charging the admission price per adult that entered the park.

Build upon your existing code from the first two iterations to implement this functionality.

## Iteration 4

The National Park Service has given you additional functionality it would like you to implement. They would like to be able to track patrons of their parks. They would like to be able to generate a list of names of all attendees, as well as generate a list of minors and a list of adults. It would like all of these lists to be sorted alphabetically.
